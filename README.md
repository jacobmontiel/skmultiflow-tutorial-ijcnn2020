# Machine learning for data streams in Python with scikit-multiflow

## Tutorial, IJCNN 2020

This repository contains the notebook for the hands-on session of the tutorial.

There are two versions of the notebook:

- `skmultiflow-tutorial-ijcnn2020.ipynb` is the empty version that you can use to replicate the session.
- `skmultiflow-tutorial-ijcnn2020_reference.ipynb` is a reference with the answers for the coding parts. (This version is slightly different to the one in the video of the session as it includes some notes for offline reference).
